Hello World!

I'm Jessica, an English/Japanese bilingual web developer! I started designing webpages way back on GeoCities when I was 11 years old. My first web page was Pokemon-themed, of course. ;) Then I took a detour and pursued a career in education, but after a few years I decided to return to what brought me so much wonder and joy as a child: web development. Now I have 3+ years' experience as a full-stack software engineer. I'm enthusiastic to learn, collaborate, and achieve. My background in multicultural education lends me a unique perspective based in empathy, communication, and mentorship. I'm currently looking for my next opportunity -- seeking a dynamic role with an ethically-minded company where I can contribute, grow, and lead. I'm also interested in relocating! If you like what you see here, please reach out! :)
